        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Do-ahead steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the barbecue sauce (or substitute 3/4 to 1 cup bottled sauce): </strong>Mix all of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce (ketchup through cumin) in a saucepan and heat over medium heat. When the sauce starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minnutes, stirring frequently. (This sauce splatters everywhere once it heats up. Be prepared to wipe down your stovetop and countertops after making this!) Remove from heat.<p>You should have about 1 2/3 cups of sauce. The sauce will keep for 1 to 2 weeks refrigerated.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken (or substitute 2 cups shredded cooked chicken): </strong>Place the chicken breasts in a 4-quart or larger pot with a lid and pour the chicken broth over top. The chicken should be covered by about an inch; add additional broth or water if needed. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Check that the chicken is cooked through and registers 165F in the thickest part. Cook another few minutes if needed. Use tongs to transfer the cooked chicken breasts to a cutting board to cool briefly.<p>When the chicken is cool, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Refrigerate in an air-tight container for up to 5 days.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cook the rice (or substitute 3 cups cooked rice): </strong>Combine the rice with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 2 cups of water (or enough to cover by about an inch). Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then lower the heat and cover. Cook until the rice is tender, 35 to 45 minutes (or according to package instructions). Check occasionally and add more water if the pan seems dry before the rice is cooked.<p>Cool the cooked rice, and then transfer to a storage container. Refrigerate for up to 5 days.</p></li>
        </ol>
